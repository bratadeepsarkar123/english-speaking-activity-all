8. The man is inherently good by nature, and it is the material benefits or the society and environment he lives in that make him bad.

Human nature is not inherently bad but rather inherently good. We are born with the capacity for love, kindness, and compassion. However, external factors such as material benefits, societal pressures, and the environment we live in can corrupt our innate goodness.

When individuals are driven solely by the pursuit of material wealth and self-interest, they may engage in unethical or harmful behavior. The influence of societal norms, inequalities, and negative experiences can shape their actions and choices.

Therefore, it is crucial to create a society that nurtures and cultivates the inherent goodness in individuals. By promoting empathy, equality, and values that prioritize the well-being of all, we can mitigate the negative influences and allow the inherent goodness within us to flourish.

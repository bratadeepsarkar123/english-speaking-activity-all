15. Authority and power should be used for the benefit of the masses.

Authority and power wield great influence over society. Those in positions of authority have a responsibility to utilize their power for the greater good and the well-being of the masses.

Instead of seeking personal gain, leaders should prioritize the needs and aspirations of the people they serve. They must be accountable, transparent, and committed to promoting social justice, equality, and inclusivity.

By using authority and power responsibly, leaders can enact policies that uplift the marginalized, address systemic injustices, and create a society where every individual has equal opportunities for growth and success.

Let us demand that those in authority use their power wisely and for the betterment of all. Together, we can foster a more just and equitable world.

Thank you.

24. The craze to ape western culture is causing Indian youth to ignore their own languages and culture.

In their pursuit to emulate western trends, modern Indian youth often overlook the richness and beauty of their own languages and culture. The vibrant diversity of Indian languages and traditions is a treasure trove that connects us to our heritage and strengthens our national identity.

By neglecting Indian languages and culture, we risk losing an integral part of our collective identity and eroding the cultural fabric that makes us unique. It is essential for the youth to strike a balance between embracing global influences and preserving our indigenous languages, arts, and customs.

Let us celebrate the fusion of cultures while cherishing our roots, nurturing our native languages, and preserving the rich tapestry of Indian culture for generations to come.

Thank you.

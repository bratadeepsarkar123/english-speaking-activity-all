25. The ill effects of fear: Are Indians truly free from fear after independence?

While India gained independence from colonial rule, the question remains: are Indians genuinely free from fear? Fear manifests in various forms, hindering personal growth, social progress, and collective well-being.

Societal issues, such as inequality, corruption, and violence, contribute to a climate of fear, stifling individual expression and impeding progress. Overcoming these challenges requires a collective effort to foster a society built on justice, equality, and inclusivity.

True freedom from fear comes from addressing its root causes and nurturing an environment of trust, empathy, and accountability. By promoting social harmony, empowering individuals, and upholding the principles of justice, we can strive towards a society where every Indian truly lives without fear.

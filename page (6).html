6. Freedom from fear is more important than legal justice for the poor. Comment.

Legal justice is undoubtedly important for a fair and equitable society. However, without freedom from fear, justice alone cannot guarantee a dignified life for the poor. Fear, whether it is fear of violence, oppression, or insecurity, can cripple individuals and communities, hindering their progress and well-being.

When people live in constant fear, their basic human rights are compromised, and their ability to pursue education, employment, and happiness is severely limited. Therefore, ensuring freedom from fear becomes a crucial prerequisite for the effective realization of legal justice.

Addressing the root causes of fear, such as poverty, inequality, and social injustice, is essential for creating a society where the poor can truly experience justice, security, and empowerment.

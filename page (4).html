Child labor, a harsh reality for the poor, robs children of their childhood and hinders their future prospects. It is a pressing issue that deprives them of education, health, and proper development. These children, forced into labor to support their families, face exploitation, abuse, and hazardous working conditions.

We must address the root causes of child labor, such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate social support systems. By promoting access to quality education, poverty alleviation, and creating awareness, we can combat this grave injustice.

Every child deserves the right to a safe and nurturing environment, free from the burdens of labor. Let us work together to eradicate child labor and provide these vulnerable children with the opportunity to thrive, learn, and build a brighter future.

Thank you.

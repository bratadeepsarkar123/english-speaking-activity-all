16. Fortune favors the brave.

Fortune favors those who display courage and take bold actions. When we step outside our comfort zones, embrace risks, and pursue our dreams with unwavering determination, we create opportunities for success.

Fortune is not solely dependent on luck but rather on the willingness to seize opportunities and persist in the face of challenges. It is through bravery that we uncover hidden paths, overcome obstacles, and achieve extraordinary feats.

By embracing courage and daring to defy the status quo, we open doors to new possibilities and pave our way to greatness. So, let us be brave, for fortune smiles upon those who fearlessly chase their aspirations.

Thank you.
